1. Geolocation.
   This plugin provides latitude and longtitude information about the device. But without guarantee of the device's actual location.
   In order for the plugin to work "deviceready" event must be added.

  *****

   document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);
  			function onDeviceReady() {
    		console.log("navigator.geolocation works well");
   		   }
  ****

  So the methods used are:
  1. navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition
  2. navigator.geolocation.watchPosition
  3. navigator.geolocation.clearWatch

  Objects:
  1. Position
  2. PositionError
  3. Coordinates
  
 -navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition-
 This returns the device's current position to the "geolocationSuccess" callback with a "Position" object as the parameter. If there is an error, the "geolocationError" callback is passed a "PositionError" object.


Parameters

1. geolocationSuccess: The callback that is passed the current position.
2. geolocationError: (Optional) The callback that executes if an error occurs.
3. geolocationOptions: (Optional) The geolocation options.

-navigator.geolocation.watchPosition-
Returns the device's current position when a change in position is detected. When the device retrieves a new location, the geolocationSuccess callback executes with a Position object as the parameter. If there is an error, the geolocationError callback executes with a PositionError object as the parameter.

Returns
String: returns a watch id that references the watch position interval. The watch id should be used with navigator.geolocation.clearWatch to stop watching for changes in position.


2. Google Navigate.
   This plugin navigates device user to location. With the method query, success, fail.
   Not much is said about this plugin, pretty straightforward it seems.

   query:   Navigate to location. Can be in "address,zipcode,city" or "lat,lon" form
   success: Called without args. if request was successful
   fail:    Called with errMsg as argument if request was unsuccessful
